ForkFlow is a decentralized reality simulation sandbox with branching capabilities, combining the depth of Dwarf Fortress with the programmability of Screeps. The game world evolves on Git-like principles, where every change is a commit, and players can create and merge alternative history branches in a fully P2P network.

## 🌟 Key Features

-  **Decentralized Branching Reality**: Fork the world, experiment, and attempt to merge your changes back into the main branch. World history is a decentralized acyclic commit graph.
-  **P2P Architecture**: The future version will operate on a fully peer-to-peer network where each player is a node storing and synchronizing the universe state.
-  **Programmable Agents**: Control "avatars" by programming their AI in ForkScript (a custom Lua framework). They possess memory and act autonomously.
-  **Deterministic Simulation**: The game core uses a special ContinuumScript language to describe world changes, ensuring determinism and clean merging in a distributed system.
-  **Emergent Gameplay**: Complex scenarios emerge naturally from interactions between dozens of agents, players, and reality branches.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

-  **Core**: C++23
-  **Networking**: Boost.Asio (with gradual transition to pure P2P)
-  **Scripting**: LuaJIT
-  **Graphics/Sound/Input**: SDL3
-  **Cryptography**: OpenSSL (for delta signing and P2P authentication)
-  **Serialization**: SQLite

## 🚧 Project Status

The project is at a very early stage of active development. Current work focuses on core architecture, delta systems, and virtual machine implementation. The current version uses a client-server model as a stepping stone toward a full P2P architecture.
